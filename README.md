# Ongoing Personal Projects
- **Battle over Antigoneia**

Currently I am working on a singleplayer Grand Strategy game inspired by Total War, Stellaris, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada and Steel Division 2. The player controls their faction in a turn-based campaign on a galaxy, managing diplomacy, income, characters, ships and planets, and then confronts other factions' fleets in real-time battles.
